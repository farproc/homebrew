Homebrew
========

What is this fork actaully about?
---------------------------------
Its a few simple scripts to wrap around homebrew to be able to create a homebrew dvd (cd?) with everything on it you need. No need for a internet connection!

The approach is to simply mirror everything referenced from within the Formulas and then make a simple mod to each formula to actually reference the mirrored versions.




Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarized on the homepage][home].

What Packages Are Available?
----------------------------
1. You can [browse the Formula directory on GitHub][formula].
2. Or type `brew search` for a list.
3. Or run `brew server` to browse packages off of a local web server.
4. Or visit [braumeister.org][braumeister] to browse packages online.
