Homebrew
========

What is this fork actaully about?
---------------------------------
Its a few simple scripts to wrap around homebrew to be able to create a homebrew dvd (cd?) with everything on it you need. No need for a internet connection! homebrew already almost has this functionlity in the form of the ```brew fetch``` command - this branch makes no sense.


Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarized on the homepage][home].

What Packages Are Available?
----------------------------
1. You can [browse the Formula directory on GitHub][formula].
2. Or type `brew search` for a list.
3. Or run `brew server` to browse packages off of a local web server.
